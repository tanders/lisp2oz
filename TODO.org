* Remove files from template

  sources/general.lisp
  resources/icon/*




* Make generation of socket port number more stable		    :ARCHIVE:

  Can I ask OS to generate fresh/unused port number?

  *Better: There is probably a way to free the port I used before*

  For example, Oz sockets understand the method close (http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/system/node55.html#chapter.open)



* Make sure the Lisp function quit-oz cannot close socket too early :ARCHIVE:



* Avoid that more than one OzServer can be started at any time

  run-oz does nothing before quit-oz has been called

* Make Oz compiler GUI optional 


* Allow that Oz compiler is OPI (i.e. the compiler also seen by emacs)
